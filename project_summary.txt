# ScreenshotHero - Project Summary

## Overview
ScreenshotHero is a web application that allows users to upload screenshots and edit the text within them while matching fonts very closely to the original. The app will be mobile-friendly first, as most users will be uploading screenshots from their phones. The application will also support additional features like removing objects/logos, enhancing images, and translating text.

## Core Functionality
1. Screenshot Upload
   - Users can upload screenshots from their devices

2. Text Editing
   - Detect text in screenshots using OCR
   - Allow users to select text and replace it
   - Match font styles, sizes, and positioning very precisely
   - Provide tools to adjust position, font style, color, size, etc.
   - Provide a "Compare" feature to overlay edited text with original

3. Additional Key Features
   - Screenshot Enhancement (denoising, sharpening, color correction, light/dark mode conversion, stitching)
   - Object/Logo Removal using AI-powered inpainting
   - Multi-language Support (OCR in multiple languages, automatic translation, preserved formatting)

## Technical Stack
- Frontend: Next.js with TypeScript
- Backend/Auth/Database: Supabase
- Image Processing: Tesseract.js for OCR, Fabric.js/Konva.js for canvas manipulation
- Font Matching: Fontkit library, curated web fonts
- Payments: Stripe integration
- Deployment: Vercel (preferred over Render for Next.js optimization)

## User Flow & Authentication
- **Anonymous Access:** Users can visit the main page (or landing page later), upload a screenshot, and use the editing tools without needing to log in or register.
- **Login Trigger:** Authentication (login/signup) is required *only* when the user attempts to download the final edited image, potentially to remove a watermark or access premium features.
- **Post-Login:** After successful login/signup triggered by the download action, the user's work should ideally be associated with their account, and the download should proceed.
- User signup/login via Supabase
- Stripe integration for processing payments
- Potential subscription model for premium features

## Action Plan Roadmap

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Basic Infrastructure (1-2 weeks)
- [x] Set up Next.js project with TypeScript
- [x] Configure Supabase for authentication and database
- [x] Set up Vercel deployment pipeline
- [x] Create basic responsive UI components
- [x] Implement user authentication flow

**Progress Notes (April 18, 2025):**
- Successfully set up Next.js 15.x project with TypeScript
- Integrated Supabase Auth UI for authentication
- Fixed critical auth flow issues:
  1. Properly handling cookies in middleware
  2. Added Suspense boundary for useSearchParams
  3. Streamlined auth callback route
  4. Implemented error handling via URL parameters
- Configured Vercel deployment and resolved build issues

**Next Steps:**
1. Test the authentication flow end-to-end
2. Add proper environment variables in Vercel
3. Set up database tables in Supabase for user data
4. Begin implementing screenshot upload functionality

### Phase 2: Core Screenshot Upload & Analysis (2-3 weeks)
- [ ] Implement screenshot upload functionality
- [ ] Set up image storage in Supabase
- [ ] Implement OCR using Tesseract.js
- [ ] Create text region detection algorithm
- [ ] Build basic text selection interface

### Phase 3: Text Editing Capabilities (3-4 weeks)
- [ ] Develop canvas-based text editing system
- [ ] Implement font detection/matching capabilities
- [ ] Create position adjustment controls
- [ ] Build the font style configuration UI
- [ ] Implement "Compare" functionality

### Phase 4: Enhanced Features (2-3 weeks)
- [ ] Implement screenshot enhancement features
   - [ ] Image quality improvement
   - [ ] Color correction 
   - [ ] Theme changing
   - [ ] Screenshot stitching
- [ ] Develop object/logo removal capabilities
   - [ ] AI-powered inpainting
   - [ ] Smart area selection

### Phase 5: Multi-language Support (2 weeks)
- [ ] Extend OCR to support multiple languages
- [ ] Implement automatic translation
- [ ] Ensure formatting preservation during translation

### Phase 6: Payment Integration & User Management (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] Set up Stripe payment processing
- [ ] Create subscription tiers and plans
- [ ] Implement usage limits for free vs. paid tiers

### Phase 7: Testing, Optimization & Launch (2-3 weeks)
- [ ] Comprehensive testing across devices
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Security auditing
- [ ] Beta testing with select users
- [ ] Official launch

## Technical Challenges
1. Precise font matching from raster images
2. Accurate text positioning and styling
3. Object removal with natural background filling
4. Mobile-friendly UI for detailed editing operations
5. Processing large images efficiently in the browser

## Project Structure Considerations

- The backend will be developed first to handle all core API, authentication, image processing, and database logic.
- The project will be organized to easily support a future public-facing landing page, which will be developed as a separate module or directory.
- Example directory structure:

```
/ScreenshotHero
  /backend         # All API, serverless functions, Supabase integration, Stripe, etc.
  /app             # Main web app (user dashboard, screenshot editor, etc.)
  /landing-page    # Public marketing/landing page (to be built in the future)
  /shared          # Shared utilities, types, or assets
  /docs            # Documentation and project planning
```

## Future Expansion Possibilities
1. Collaboration features
2. Templates and presets
3. Integration with design tools
4. AI-suggested edits
5. Branded overlay options
6. Tutorial creation tools

This roadmap provides a structured approach to building ScreenshotHero, starting with core functionality and progressively adding more advanced features.
